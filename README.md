# Movie-Database
 
## Project Description

Movie Database to analyze a subset of IMDB data to test hypootheses of what makes a successful movie

## Hypotheses tested

1) Does the MPAA rating of a movie affect how much revenue the movie generates?

2) Do longer movies generate more revenue?

3) Does populatiry affect the amount of revenue a movie makes?

### Hypothesis 1

Null Hypothesis: The MPAA rating of a movie does not affect how much revenue the movie generates

Alternate Hypothesis: The MPAA rating of a movie has an affect on how much revenue the movie will generate

#### Results

- Reject null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis

- PG & PG13 show significant statistical evidence vs R & NC17 to reject the null hypothesis

### Hypothesis 2

Null Hypothesis: Longer movies do not make a difference in revenue

Alternate Hypothesis: Longer movies generate more revenue

#### Results

- Our P value is less than the threshold of 0.05

- Accept null hypothesis

### Hypothesis 3

Null Hypothesis: There is no difference in revenue related to a movie's popularity

Alternate Hypothesis: Popularity has an effect on a movie's revenue

#### Results

- With a P-Value of 0.11, we can reject the null hypothesis
