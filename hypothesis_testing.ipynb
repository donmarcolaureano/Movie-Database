    "# Questions to Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "## - The stakeholder's first question is: does the MPAA rating of a movie (G/PG/PG-13/R) affect how much revenue the movie generates?\n",
    "\n",
    "- They want you to perform a statistical test to get a mathematically-supported answer.\n",
    "- They want you to report if you found a significant difference between ratings.\n",
    "- If so, what was the p-value of your analysis?\n",
    "- And which rating earns the most revenue?\n",
    "- They want you to prepare a visualization that supports your finding.\n",
    "\n",
    "## - It is then up to you to think of 2 additional hypotheses to test that your stakeholder may want to know.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Some example hypotheses you could test:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do movies that are over 2.5 hours long earn more revenue than movies that are 1.5 hours long (or less)?\n",
    "- Do movies released in 2020 earn less revenue than movies released in 2018?\n",
    "- How do the years compare for movie ratings?\n",
    "- Do some movie genres earn more revenue than others?\n",
    "- Are some genres higher rated than others? etc."
